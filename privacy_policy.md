**Privacy Policy**

Özgün Özerk built the HowMuch app as an Open Source app. This SERVICE is provided by Özgün Özerk at no cost and is intended for use as is.

This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.

If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving the Service. I will not use or share your information.

The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at HowMuch unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collection and Use

For a better experience while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information, including but not limited to an email address and first name. Your first name won't be stored in our servers, we only store your email address (google account), and derive your first name from that account on the fly.

### Log Data

I want to inform you that I do not collect any Log Data.

### Cookies

Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

### Service Providers

I may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons:

* To facilitate our Service;
* To provide the Service on our behalf;
* To perform Service-related services; or
* To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.

I want to inform users of this Service that only Google/Firebase has access to users' Personal Information for the specified purposes.

### Security

I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information; thus, we strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Links to Other Sites

This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.

### Children’s Privacy

I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. I encourage all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. Parents and legal guardians are encouraged to monitor their children's Internet usage. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information, please contact us. Users must be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of personally identifiable information.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.

This policy is effective as of 2023-12-12.
